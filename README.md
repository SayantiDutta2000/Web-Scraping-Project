# Web-Scraping-Project
The objective of the project is to extract the Multiple Choice Question and Answers of 11th standard Mathematics from a website which will help the students to access all the scrapped data (question and answers) in one go and fetch the same from the CSV format easily.
A  Python script named  Maths_Question_Answer.ipynb is written which scarpes all the question and answers using BeautifulSoup4 and requests package to parse the HTML file. The question along with four choices associated with each question is stored in Class_11_Maths.csv file. 
The correct answer to each question is stored in another csv file named Maths_Class11_Answer.csv. Thus, with the help of Web Scraping large amount of data can be fetched very easily as the process of the data extraction is done in an efficient and fast way  since many websites have data which does not allows us to directly copy ,paste and save  data in a format of our choice. Therefore, Web Scraping simplifies the process of data extraction , saves us from the trouble of manually downloading and copying it by ramping up the entire process of automation and creating easy access to the scrapped data by providing it in a CSV format.
Moreover, predictive analysis can be done to gain future insights which is one of the vital reason for which Web Scraping has paramount significance.
