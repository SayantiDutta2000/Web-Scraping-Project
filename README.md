# Web-Scraping-Project
The objective of the project is to extract the Multiple Choice Question and Answers of 11th standard Mathematics from a website which will help the students to access all the scrapped data (question and answers) in one go and fetch the same from the CSV format easily.
A Python script named Maths_Question_Answer.ipynb is written which scarpes all the question and answers using BeautifulSoup4 and requests package to parse the HTML file.
The question along with four choices associated with each question is stored in Class_11_Maths.csv file.
The correct answer to each question is stored in another file named  Maths_Class11_Answer.csv file.
Thus, large amount of data can be fetched very easily as the process of automating the data extraction is done in an efficient and fast way through Web Scraping.
